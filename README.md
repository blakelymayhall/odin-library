- Began the project by sketching ideas for the UI in Freeform 

<img src="dev/mockup.png">

- Concept is that when a card is clicked, it opens an overlay with the book information 
- Implemented the design with the intention to iterate later 
    - Decor in the blank spaces
    - Decorative buttons rather than text buttons
    - Better responsive UI
        - Looks terrible on iPhone
        - If squished, the cards get pretty small
