# Process Notes

8/6/23 - 8/7/23 

- Began the project by sketching ideas for the UI in Freeform 

<img src="dev/mockup.png">

- Concept is that when a card is clicked, it opens an overlay with the book information 
- Implemented the design with the intention to iterate later 
    - Decor in the blank spaces
    - Decorative buttons rather than text buttons
    - Better responsive UI
        - Looks terrible on iPhone
        - If squished, the cards get pretty small

8/8/23 - 8/9/23
- Implement an initial array of books that populate the DOM on startup
- Reorged code to be more readable

8/12/23 - 8/16/23
- Implement on-click overlay form designs
- Still some work to finish out here but the bones are filling in

TODO:
- Add images to the banners to make it look better
- More responsive display
- Maybe play with the background of the books... canned image(s)?
